        <h3>Ever wondered who is behind the scenes? </h3>
         <p>I am a Media, Journalism and Publishing student at the Oxford Brookes University. I was born and raised in Germany by my lovely parents, grew up with my three siblings as well as our dog and cat.(Yes you can be a dog AND a cat person). It was not until 2020 that I came to the UK to start my future career.</p>

<div class=WhatIdid>
  <h3>What I did & what I want to do</h3>
       <p> Before I started my course in the UK I studied food chemistry in Germany for three years. To be honest with you, that career was not creative and flexible enough for me. But I still share the love of scientific adventures and logic behind little things. So Typologically was born, the rest is history ;)
         </p>
       <p> Futuristically speaking, I would like to combine design and creativity with the knowledge and theories I gained in the past. Design has many connections to scientific precision, you could argue that I didn't completly change my direction. But this is much more fun.

<div class=WhatILove> 
  <h3>What I love</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> coffee </li>
      <li> cake</li>
      <li>colours</li>
      <li>coasts</li>
    </ul>

       <p> I am happy about every nicely brewed cup of coffee, especially when its accompanied by a wonderful novel. When I paint with bright colours I can easily loose track of time, it is a wonderful way to relax. Of course, cooking food and eating it will remain always a favourite, especially after a lovely walk at the coast. I do sports as long as I can remember, if I wouldn't move I would become fidgety and for me its very useful to empty my head after a long day. Besides, travelling and exploring the world is fascinating, but I would't describe it as my hobby. It is not part of my daily life even if I would love to. </p>
