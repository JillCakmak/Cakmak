*Typologically*? Ever heard of it? What does it even deal with? 



I created that website to logically explain everyday typographyâ€“So far so good. 

**But why?** The 'why' question is the most essential question I would ask myself every day. Typography is everywhere around us. To observe some little things in life might make it way more exciting to you! (At least I am happy about every new logic behind a small thing) 

So let's start our **adventure** together and explore the world! Most of my articles will be personally influenced by my favourite topics: Arts, Books and Food. 

The biggest and most surprising parts about *Typologically* are the different opinions and thoughts about specific topics, and more importantly the **emotions** you will connect with the brands and items! 

So please let me know what you think and what topics I should cover as well! 



Take care everyone and have as much fun as I, while exploring for you.
