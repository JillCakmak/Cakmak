**Is chocolate just chocolate? Or do you have specific preferences regarding brand and look? The difference between two famous beloved chocolate companies will be outlined below. Cadbury vs. Lindt in what team are you? Let's find out!**



## Choco History

*Cadbury* was founded in Birmingham, 1824. The company started on a small scale. John Cadbury aimed to sell his chocolate powder and drinks as a substitution for alcohol, advertising a healthier lifestyle \[Mondelez]. It wasn't until 1849 that *Cadbury* produced the first UK chocolate bar. 

A couple of years earlier, *Lindt* was established, to be precise 1845. The Sprüngli Brothers' goal was to be the first company producing solid chocolate for the swiss german area \[Lindt&Sprüngli].

Both businesses achieved major steps in the development of chocolate. *Cadbury* created, with the use of pure cacao, the first easter egg in 1875. *Lindt* achieved to develop the first melting chocolate worldwide in 1879. 

So what is the difference between the brands if both achieved milestones in chocolate production? 

Let's typologically analyse the cocoa of the bean. 



#### Logo&Typography

##### 1. Cadbury

Even though Cadbury changed its font in 2020, its purple colour will always implement the brand Cadbury. Many cannot imagine the brand without the outstanding colour set. First used in 1920, the colour 2685 C, is over a hundred years old. 

Purple gives a feeling of luxury and speciality. Historically, purple was mostly used in royal families, due to its costs. Before globalisation and technologies, it was hard to craft the colour due to the limited capacities of material. Nowadays, the colour is often used for chocolate brands (Dairymilk, Milka), it emphasizes a small treat of luxury in daily life.

The two different fonts have many things in common. Its handwritten style is golden with low x-height and some shadow details. 

Past: The condensed font is heavyweight and regular in contrast, it is aligned at a 30-degree angle horizontally and made the C jump out. Through the movement, it seems fun and active. 

Present (2020): The condensed font is lightweight and the high contrast underlines the curves of the handwriting. Additionally, it is now aligned horizontally and seems neater. With its higher contrast in comparison to the old logo, it seems less playful but more luxurious. 

Those slight changes can have a higher impact on the consumer. The brand clearly tries to implement new values to sell more products. With its new logo, it underlines the message that they want to sell good quality chocolate for everyone. Now, with the less playful voice, it might help to win new audiences. 

The famous Cadbury egg, for example, is very colourful, inviting especially kids and families to buy it.
