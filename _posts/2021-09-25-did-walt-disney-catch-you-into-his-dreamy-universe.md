**Did you know that the Brand image of Disney over nearly 100 years just slightly changed?** **Have you ever thought of the impact the *Disney* logo makes on you before starting a movie? Have you been in the cinema, staring at the wall, while the heavily detailed and up-to-date 3D animation of the Disney castle came up? Your body buzzing for adrenalin and excitement to see the new work of creative heads?** 

**Well if not– don't worry– *Typologically* got you!**

Everyone started somewhere, and so did *Walt Disney*. It was not until 1937 that Disney created a recurring Logo – and it changed several times. During that time *Disney* started to gain more popularity after several ups and downs; which is, most potentially, the reason for a fixed logo. 

Starting with a simple curvy *Walt Disney*, followed by a more edgy style of cursive letters in 1948. The second change of the font in 1972, is the one we still see and love nowadays. Over the years some 'add-ons' of the logo were developed. 

First, the line of ‘productions’ was added in a simple steady font (1972). In 1983 the line ‘productions’ was substituted by ‘Pictures’. It wasn't until 1985, that the famous illustration of the *Disney* castle in the background was edited. The, so far, last change was made in 2006. Again, just the edit of the castle was reframed and modernized. It’s now illustrated with much more detail in a square frame. 

What’s the logic behind that? *Typologically* thinking is it clear that the slight adjustments during the time helped *Disney* to support their brand identity, as well it will be recognizable over generations.

In other words, the company constantly showed their skills through its logo; the film industry is a highly competitive market, but *Walt Disney* achieved it to stand out. 

 Since their massive impact on the industry and their success as a brand, they reuse their logo with slight changes for every area, where they develop new media products. Such as the *Disney+* or the *Disney Channel* logo.

When you look at the logo, from a very personal perspective, you might connect special feelings from your childhood with it. For many people, *Disney* with its castle evokes beautifully dreamy fantasies and embraces the doorstep to childhood dreams. It's psychologically proven that your brain connects different aspects of your childhood experience with something positive. This is why adults tend to re-experience childhood memories, to evoke the positive emotions they had a couple of years before.
